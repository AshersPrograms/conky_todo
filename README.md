# conky_todo

This is a widget plug-in made for conky

## Features

- System Info: displays the Kernel, CPU, and Ram Usage
- Todo: Displays To does that your list in the todo.txt

## Installation

- Install Conky.
- Download and extract content to ~/.conky/
- You will see the new plug in when you open Conky Manager.

## Usage: How to Edit the todo.txt file

- With your favorite text editor open the file ~/.conky/todo/todo.txt
  
## Advanced Usage: Todo Task Status using AutoKey

- I created two Task Status with AutoKey - (NEXT-UP) with an Abbreviation :n and (IN-PROGRESS) with an Abbreviation :p
- Now, when I add a todo, I can add task status using the Abbreviations I created, and it will reflect in the Conky (you need to have AutoKey already runing for this)

## Additional Options:
- Optional create a link to the todo file.
- Open a terminal and type:
- ln -s ~/.conky/conky_todo/conky_todo.txt ~/Desktop/todo.txt
